# Backend Engineering Standards — NestJS + MongoDB + CQRS/DDD

> Mandatory rules for all backend code. Framework-agnostic of any single feature.
> Stack: **NestJS · MongoDB (Mongoose) · CQRS (`@nestjs/cqrs`) · DDD with orchestrators**.
> Frontend is React + TypeScript (out of scope here, but contracts must serve it).
> Write code for the next reader: clear, safe, hard to misuse. Code is read far more than written.

## 1. Architecture (DDD + CQRS + Orchestrators)

- Organize by **bounded context / feature**, never by technical layer at the top level. Folders scream the domain (`<feature>/`, e.g. `orders/`, `users/`), not the framework.
- Inside each context, dependencies point **inward**: `interface → application → domain`, with `infrastructure` implementing domain ports. The domain depends on nothing external (no Nest, no Mongoose, no HTTP).
- Layer responsibilities — each does exactly one job:
  - **domain/** — entities, value objects, domain events, repository *ports* (interfaces), domain services, invariants. Pure, framework-free, deterministic.
  - **application/** — commands, queries, their handlers, orchestrators, sagas, DTOs in/out, mappers. Owns use-cases.
  - **infrastructure/** — Mongoose schemas, repository implementations, persistence mappers, external clients, config.
  - **interface/** — controllers, request/response DTOs, guards, pipes, HTTP concerns only.
- **CQRS split is strict**: commands mutate state and return nothing meaningful (or an id); queries read and never mutate. Never mix read and write in one handler. Use separate read models when read shapes diverge from write models.
- **Command/Query handler** = the entry point for a use-case. It validates intent, loads aggregates via ports, applies domain logic, persists, dispatches domain events.
- **Orchestrator** = coordinates *multiple* modules/services when a flow crosses bounded contexts. It calls each module's service/handler, sequences them, and returns the result. It **coordinates, never decides** — no business rules live in an orchestrator. Keep it thin.
- **Orchestrators may nest** (orchestrator of orchestrators), but this is where god-objects creep in: every level stays decision-free and single-purpose, or the boundary has already collapsed.
- **Saga** = reacts to domain events for long-running / cross-aggregate flows (eventual consistency, compensations). Use a saga, not an orchestrator, when the trigger is an event rather than a direct call.
- **One responsibility per level**: Entity owns data + invariants → Service/Handler owns domain rules → Orchestrator coordinates → Saga reacts. Never tunnel through a layer.
- **Extend, don't edit**: add new flows by composing new handlers/orchestrators/strategies, not by rewriting tested code (Open/Closed at the architecture level).
- Each domain entity/aggregate owns **exactly one** repository, and is the only code that talks to it. No cross-aggregate repository access.
- Define and respect **bounded contexts**: a concept in one context must not leak into another. Cross-context communication goes through published contracts/events, not shared internals.
- Speak the **ubiquitous language**: classes, variables, collections, and events use the words the business uses.

## 2. SOLID & design

- **SRP** — one module, one reason to change. Split god classes and giant methods on sight.
- **OCP** — open to extension, closed to modification; add behavior without touching tested code.
- **LSP** — any implementation must substitute for its interface without surprising callers.
- **ISP** — small, specific interfaces; depend only on methods you use.
- **DIP** — high-level and low-level code both depend on abstractions. Controllers/services depend on repository *interfaces*, never concrete Mongoose models.
- Favor **composition over inheritance** ("has-a" over brittle "is-a" trees).
- Use the **Strategy pattern** to swap interchangeable algorithms at runtime instead of growing `switch`/`if` chains.
- **DRY** — every fact, type, constant, and contract lives in exactly one place. Reuse shared domain types across handlers and contracts.

## 3. NestJS module & DI conventions

- Structure by feature module: one `*.module.ts` is the boundary of each context, declaring its `controllers` and `providers` explicitly (no magic scanning).
- A module is the source of truth for its domain. **Private by default**: a provider is internal unless intentionally `exports`-ed. Exports are the module's public contract.
- A module that needs another domain **imports that domain's module directly** — never reaches through a third module or a shared "god/common" module.
- Prefer many small, single-responsibility providers over one bloated service.
- DI rules: mark managed classes `@Injectable()`; **constructor injection only**; inject by type/abstraction; never `new` a service manually.
- Treat services as **singletons** (one shared instance per module scope): no per-request mutable state.
- Scaffold with the Nest CLI (`nest g ...`); don't hand-roll boilerplate.
- Naming: `<Feature>Module`, `<Feature>Controller`, `<Feature>Service`, files `<feature>.module.ts`, `<feature>.controller.ts`, `<feature>.service.ts`. No abbreviations, no vague names. Keep files short and readable.

## 4. HTTP layer (controllers, DTOs, validation)

- **Thin controllers**: parse input → delegate to a command/query (or orchestrator) → map result to a response. They decide nothing.
- Resource-oriented, RESTful routes: plural collection paths, singular-with-id for one resource. Stable, opaque ids in URLs. Keep routes shallow; nest only when a child strictly belongs to one parent.
- Use HTTP methods semantically: `GET` read (safe, idempotent), `POST` create, `PUT` full replace, `PATCH` partial update, `DELETE` remove.
- Separate inputs by role: **path params = identity**, **query params = filter/sort/paginate/options**, **body = payload**. Never put identity in query or large/structured data in path/query.
- Use Nest parameter decorators (`@Param`, `@Query`, `@Body`, `@Headers`) — never touch the raw `req`/`res` for input.
- **DTOs are contracts**, independent of DB and ORM. Separate DTOs per use-case (`Create…Dto`, `Update…Dto`, response DTOs); no "god DTO". DTOs hold shape only — no logic, no persistence concerns. Keep them in a `dto/` folder per feature.
- Use **DTO classes** (not interfaces) so Nest can validate at runtime. Put all validation on DTO fields with `class-validator` decorators (type, presence, length, format, enum). No ad-hoc checks in controllers.
- Enable a **global `ValidationPipe`** once in `main.ts` (`whitelist`, `forbidNonWhitelisted`, `transform`). Controllers then assume validated input.
- Server-generated fields (ids, timestamps) never appear in create bodies.
- Return JSON via plain objects (rely on Nest auto-serialization). Set status codes precisely: `200` read, `201` created, `204` no body. Use `@HttpCode()` only to override deliberately.
- Return **complete, normalized resources** from writes, not bare status.
- Wrap collections in an **envelope** (e.g. `{ items, nextCursor }`) rather than a bare array, for forward compatibility. Include pagination fields from day one.

## 5. Persistence (MongoDB + Mongoose)

- The **repository port** lives in the domain (an interface around domain operations, not low-level storage ops). The **Mongoose implementation** lives in infrastructure. Controllers/services/handlers depend only on the port.
- Only the repository talks to the Mongoose model/DB. No business rules and no HTTP knowledge in repositories; no DB calls in services/controllers.
- All repository operations are **async** (return Promises), so storage can change without touching callers.
- Configure the connection with `MongooseModule.forRootAsync` reading `MONGO_URL` from config; use `MongooseModule.forFeature` per feature module to register its models. Self-contained modules.
- **Schema rules**: explicit `type` for every field; `required` only when always present; `default` for optional auto-fill; built-in validators (`minlength`, `maxlength`, `min`, `max`, `enum`) over manual checks. Schemas live in the data layer and hold no business logic.
- Use `{ timestamps: true }` instead of hand-rolled `createdAt`/`updatedAt`.
- Use `Types.ObjectId` for relationship fields, always paired with a correct `ref`. Treat ObjectIds as backend identity; convert to strings only at the DTO boundary.
- **Modeling by access pattern**, not aesthetics. Design from real read/write flows; optimize the common reads.
  - **Embed** small, bounded, tightly-coupled data read with its parent (gains single-document atomicity). Keep embedded arrays bounded — previews/summaries, not full history.
  - **Reference** one-to-many / many-to-many or unbounded child sets, and anything queried independently. Referencing loses cross-document atomicity — handle multi-doc consistency explicitly.
  - Prefer arrays of foreign ids on a clear owning document over link collections, unless the relationship itself carries data.
  - Add small denormalized summary fields only when they meaningfully cut reads. Never let an array grow unbounded inside a document (16 MB limit).
- **Querying**: `find(filter, projection)` — filter chooses documents, projection chooses fields. Use comparison/`$in`/logical operators instead of filtering in code. Use **inclusion projection** (`field: 1`) for responses; never mix inclusion and exclusion (except `_id`). Fetch the minimum necessary data.
- **Indexes** at the schema level (`schema.index(...)`), never in services. Index hot query/sort fields. Prefer compound indexes for multi-field filters/sorts; respect the **left-prefix rule** and align key direction with the sort. `unique` indexes enforce invariants. Index per real workload; avoid index bloat (each index costs writes + RAM/disk).
- **Aggregation** for analytics/reporting, not ad-hoc code. `$match` as early as possible; `$group` only for real aggregation (`_id` = group key, everything else accumulated); `$sort` after `$group` for top-N; `$lookup` only when joining (flatten the resulting array for single matches); `$project` last to shape output. Keep business meaning (time ranges) in services; repositories take explicit dates/limits. Keep type/id consistency (ObjectId vs string, Date vs number).
- **Pagination**: cursor-based, not `skip`/offset, for changing timelines. Define a stable total ordering (`createdAt` + unique tie-breaker like `_id`); fix the sort across pages; use "after/before this item" with **strict inequalities** (`<`/`>`) to avoid duplicates/gaps. Implement as filter → sort → limit. Align the compound index with the query. Cursors are opaque encoded tokens.

## 6. DAO / DTO boundary & mappers

- **DAO** (Mongoose document shape) stays inside the persistence layer; never returned from controllers or services.
- Map DAO → domain/DTO with **dedicated, pure mapper functions** (no I/O, no side effects), written **field-by-field** to prevent accidental leaks. Centralize mappers per feature; call them in the service/handler layer, not in controllers.
- Never leak Mongo internals across the API boundary: rename `_id → id`, strip `__v`, soft-delete markers, internal flags; never expose passwords/tokens/secrets; normalize non-JSON types (Date → ISO string, ObjectId → string).
- Services/handlers return **DTOs only**; controllers never see DAOs.

## 7. Errors & validation boundary

- **Don't trust external data.** TypeScript checks your code, not the network — validate every inbound payload at the boundary before it reaches domain logic.
- One **stable error envelope** for all failures: a top-level wrapper with `{ code, message }` (and optional details). This is a public contract — keep it backward compatible.
- **Machine-readable codes** (`UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`, namespaced) drive client logic; human messages are for humans and may change freely without breaking clients.
- Throw **Nest HTTP exceptions** / a domain `ApiError` type carrying HTTP status + code + message; never hand-craft error responses in handlers.
- **Centralize** formatting in one global exception filter. No duplicated try/catch + response logic per controller.
- **Fail fast** at the controller/pipe boundary on malformed input (`400`). Domain/business-rule validation lives in services and value objects and signals errors in a framework-agnostic way.
- Status mapping: `4xx` = client/contract fault (`400` invalid, `401` unauthenticated, `403` forbidden, `404` not found, `409` conflict). `5xx` = unexpected server fault only — never use `500` to mask a client mistake.
- Validators are **pure and reusable**: stateless, side-effect free; return typed values or throw a known error.

## 8. TypeScript discipline

- `as` and `any` are confessions. Prefer narrowing, type guards, and schema-derived types. Validate-then-type external data.
- Derive types from one source (DTO/schema); don't redeclare the same shape twice.
- Strong typing on every handler/param/return. No implicit `any`.

## 9. Async, performance & state

- Prefer `async/await`; never block on synchronous I/O or busy-wait loops. Keep work non-blocking and the event loop free.
- Run independent I/O **concurrently** (`Promise.all`), not serially. Don't mix callbacks and Promises in one path.
- In hot paths, treat any synchronous disk/network/CPU-heavy work as suspicious; keep heavy sync work to init only.
- **No hidden performance costs**: kill N+1 queries, repeated lookups, and re-fetches; batch and reuse. Filter/permission-scope on the **server**; the client receives only what it needs.
- **Stateless processes**: never rely on in-memory state as source of truth — it is lost on restart and not shared across instances. Persist all important state and sessions externally. Each request must be handled correctly without prior in-memory context.
- Make **side effects obvious** (I/O, state writes, event dispatch) and **ownership clear** (who creates, updates, and ends each piece of data's lifecycle).

## 10. Auth & security

- Keep authentication in a dedicated `AuthModule`; user data logic in a separate `UsersModule`; layer controller → service → repository.
- **Always hash passwords** with a password-hashing algorithm (bcrypt), never plain hashes (MD5/SHA-*). Tune the cost factor via env; rely on bcrypt's built-in salt; store only the single hash string. Verify via `compare`, never by reversing.
- Centralize hashing in a `PasswordService`, used only at the service layer. Never log plaintext passwords anywhere.
- Issue JWTs via `JwtModule`/`JwtService`; secret in env (e.g. `AUTH_SECRET`); minimal payload (id + minimal identity); sensible expiration. Use short-lived access tokens + tracked refresh tokens with server-side revocation.
- Use **Passport + `passport-jwt`** as the strategy; `validate()` returns the request user. Protect routes with a reusable `JwtAuthGuard` applied at controller or route level — not per-handler logic. Guards are thin: allow/deny only, no heavy logic.
- Use a custom `@CurrentUser()` param decorator (in `common/decorators/`) to inject `req.user`; don't re-parse or re-verify the JWT in controllers.
- Separation: **authentication → guards**, **authorization & domain rules → services**.
- Never return passwords, tokens, or secrets in responses. Return generic messages on login failure (don't reveal whether email or password was wrong). Keep secrets out of source control.

## 11. Cross-cutting Nest building blocks

- **Middleware** — low-level, framework-agnostic, runs on every request (logging, request context). Not for auth/validation.
- **Guards** — authorization allow/deny; thin and fast.
- **Pipes** — input validation/transformation before the controller; rely on the global `ValidationPipe` + DTOs.
- **Interceptors** — before/after cross-cutting concerns (timing, response wrapping, mapping). No business logic.
- Registration order = execution order. In any pipeline: log at the start; validate before business logic; call `next()` only when valid and no response sent; short-circuit with an early return on failure.
- Organize shared cross-cutting code under `src/common/{guards,pipes,interceptors,decorators,filters}`; keep each class small, focused, reusable.

## 12. Configuration & operations (12-factor)

- **Decouple config from code**: no hardcoded ports, URLs, or secrets. Inject everything at runtime.
- Load via global `ConfigModule.forRoot({ isGlobal: true })`; access through `ConfigService`, never `process.env` directly.
- Treat `process.env` as untrusted: define a **Joi validation schema** for all required vars (types, allowed values, required/optional) and wire it into `ConfigModule` to **fail fast** on missing/invalid config.
- Keep real values in `.env` (gitignored); keep a `.env.example` template with all keys and no secrets. Update both the schema and the example when adding/removing a var.
- Select environment config from `NODE_ENV`, not scattered conditionals. Use consistent, descriptive var names.

## 13. Testing

- Use **Jest** (+ supertest for HTTP). Test **real behavior** — what a caller does — not internal construction. A test that can't fail isn't a test.
- Unit-test domain logic, services/handlers, mappers, and validators in isolation (no framework, no DB) — DI makes this easy via mocked ports.
- Assert mappers include/exclude the right fields and that DTOs never carry DB-specific or sensitive fields. Treat these as guards against future leaks.
- e2e-test the HTTP contract (status codes, envelope, error shape) end-to-end.
- Refactor only behind passing tests; never change internal structure without tests guarding external behavior.

## 14. Code craft & process

- **Make intent obvious** — if a name needs a comment, the name is wrong. Comment the *why* (tradeoffs, business rules), not the *what*; treat a needed explanatory comment as a refactor smell.
- **Do one thing** — small, single-task functions, free of hidden side effects. Prefer simple, inlined code over premature abstraction; every abstraction is debt that must earn its interest.
- **Boy Scout rule** — leave each file cleaner than you found it. **Fix broken windows** — remove bad hacks and failing tests before rot spreads. **Remove dead code** — it lies to the next reader.
- **Shoot tracer bullets** — build a thin end-to-end skeleton first, then flesh it out.
- Automate formatting (ESLint/Prettier/strict mode) so reviews argue about logic, not style.
- **Focused commits**: one logical change each, `topic: verb description`. Treat PRs as artifacts: state what changed, why, where to review, what could break.
